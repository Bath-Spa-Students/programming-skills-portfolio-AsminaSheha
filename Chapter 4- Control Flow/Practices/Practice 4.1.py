#Write a python program with if statement that assigns 20 to the variable y and assigns 40 to the
#variable z if the variable & is greater than 100.

# Assume variable & is given a value
variable = 120

# Check if the variable & is greater than 100
if variable > 100:
    # If true, assign 20 to variable y and 40 to variable z
    y = 20
    z = 40
    print("y:", y)
    print("z:", z)
else:
    # If false, you can handle the situation accordingly
    print("The value of & is not greater than 100.")

# Rest of your program...
