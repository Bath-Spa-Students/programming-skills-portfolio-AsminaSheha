#Write a Python program that uses a while loop to print the even numbers from 2 to 10

# Initialize a variable with the starting value
number = 2

# Use a while loop to print even numbers from 2 to 10
while number <= 10:
    print(number)
# Increment by 2 to get the next even number
    number += 2
